say_something
say_something is a service where any text or image entered by users is instantly sent to everyone currently on the same site. Messages float up from the bottom of the screen like balloons and quickly disappear.

Features
You can specify a send_port when sending a message.

Messages sent to a specific send_port will only be visible to users who have entered the same read_port.

For fun, if you type /admin_mode in read_port, you can see messages from all ports.

Image display size has been increased for better visibility.

Chat mode added for continuous conversation view.

Shortcut added: Press Shift + Ctrl + L to clear all messages on your screen.

Usage
Feel free to use the site and have fun sharing messages!
