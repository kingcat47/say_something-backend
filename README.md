say_something
say_something is a service where any text or image entered by people is instantly sent to everyone currently on the same site.
The messages float up from the bottom of the screen like balloons and quickly disappear.

Features
You can specify a send_port when sending a message.

Messages sent to a specific send_port will only be visible to users who have entered the same read_port.

For fun, if you type /admin_mode in read_port, you will be able to see messages from all ports.

Usage
Feel free to use my site and have fun sharing messages!
